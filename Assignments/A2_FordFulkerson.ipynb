    "Let $𝑥 ∈ 𝑁^2$ be row/column coordinates of a pixel, and $𝐼(𝑥) ∈ ℝ^3$ RGB values of a pixel at location $𝑥$. Per the implementation described in the KT textbook, each pixel is treated as a graph node and must have weights for: \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) the likelihood of that pixel being background, denoted here $𝑏(𝑥)$; \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) the likelihood of that pixel being a foreground, denoted here $𝑎(𝑥)$; and \n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) the weights between neighboring pixels, denoted $𝑝(𝑥_𝑖, 𝑥_𝑗)$, where $𝑥_𝑖$ and $𝑥_𝑗$ are the coordinates of two pixels, $𝑖$ and $𝑗$. You must set these values in the following way:\n",

    "\n",
    "(where $d$ is the Euclidean distance between two pixels, and $x_a$ and $x_b$ are the coordinates of the two pixels that are the closest to $x$ and are known to be foreground and background, respectively.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In these equations $𝑑(𝐼(𝑥),𝐼(𝑥_𝑎))$ is the Euclidean distance between the RGB values at pixel coordinate $x$ and $x_a$. The coordinate $x$ is an arbitrary location in the image, while $x_a$, $x_b ∈ ℕ^2$ are coordinates of one background and one foreground pixel, respectively, that will be provided to your program as input. This is analogous to the way segmentation software is often used in practice; the user manually chooses one location in the image (i.e., a pixel coordinate) that represents the foreground they want to isolate, and one location in the image that represents the background."
